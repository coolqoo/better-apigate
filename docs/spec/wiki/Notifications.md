# Notifications

better-apigate supports webhook-based notifications for important events.

---

## Overview

Notifications are delivered via the webhook system. To receive notifications, configure a webhook endpoint and subscribe to the events you want to be notified about.

See [[Webhooks]] for webhook configuration.
See [[Events]] for the list of supported events.

| `usage.limit` | User reached usage limit |

## Setting Up Notifications

### Via Web UI

1. Navigate to **Webhooks** in the admin dashboard
2. Click **Create Webhook**
3. Enter your notification endpoint URL
4. Select the events you want to be notified about
5. Save and note the signing secret

### Example: Slack Integration

To send notifications to Slack, you can use Slack's incoming webhooks:

1. Create a Slack incoming webhook at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Create an better-apigate webhook pointing to your Slack webhook URL
3. Subscribe to desired events

Note: better-apigate sends its standard webhook payload format. For custom Slack formatting, you'll need an intermediate service to transform the payload.
