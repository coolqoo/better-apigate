# Production Deployment

Guide to deploying better-apigate in production.

---

## Quick Reference

See [[Tutorial-Production]] for a step-by-step deployment guide.

## Checklist

### Infrastructure

- [ ] SQLite database file on persistent storage (backed up)
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (ACME or manual certs)
- [ ] Reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) for SSL termination (optional)
- [ ] CDN for static assets (optional)

> **Note**: better-apigate uses SQLite for simplicity and portability. For high-traffic deployments, ensure SQLite is on fast storage (SSD) and consider running multiple read replicas behind a load balancer.

### Security

- [ ] Database file permissions restricted
- [ ] Secure admin access
- [ ] Firewall configured
- [ ] Secrets stored via settings with `--encrypted`
- [ ] Regular backups of SQLite database

### Monitoring

- [ ] Health checks configured (`/health` endpoint)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics enabled (`/metrics` endpoint)
- [ ] Log aggregation
- [ ] Alerting for errors
